# SoulLink
## Project Overview
### SoulLink is an immersive personality-matching experience designed to decode your inner self and link it to a dynamic universe of fictional characters. At its core, SoulLink is a hybrid of psychology, fandom, and narrative explorationâ€”where users discover their unique character archetype based on key personality traits, emotional intelligence, and cognitive behavior.

### Through a carefully curated system of psychological profiling, SoulLink analyzes your responses to match you with a character who embodies your dominant traits, inner conflicts, strengths, and vulnerabilities. Whether you're a logical strategist, an empathetic dreamer, or a chaotic rebel, SoulLink helps you visualize the inner forces that shape your decisions, motivations, and relationships.
